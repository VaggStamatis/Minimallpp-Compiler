# Compilers 
This program helps you compile a Minimall++ code to Assembly executable code

## Inputs 
Takes a **.txt** file (as the one in the example) that contains code written in Minimall++

## Outputs
Outputs 2 different files 
- One file with the **.int** suffix containing the quads
- One file with the **.asm** suffix containing the Assembly executable code 

### Minimall++
Minimall++ is an experimental language that is used in the lesson of Compilers (**CSE Univercity Of Ioannina**) to further understand the use and the functionality of compilers 

# Creator 
Created from *Evangelos Stamatis* as part of his undergraduate studies at the Computer Science and Engineering department of the Univercity of Ioannina
